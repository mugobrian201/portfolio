  <h1>Fourth-Year Project</h1>
  <p>This research developed advanced risk management models to address the financial challenges posed by increasing life expectancies in the insurance industry. <br> With the continuous rise in life expectancy due to improvements in healthcare, nutrition, and living conditions, traditional mortality models have become less reliable, leading to significant financial risks for insurers. <br> These risks included increased annuity and pension liabilities, higher healthcare costs, and regulatory pressures to maintain adequate capital reserves. <br> To tackle these challenges, this study employed the Lee-Carter Model, a widely recognized stochastic mortality model, to forecast mortality trends and assess longevity risk. <br> The model was applied to data collected from online sources, that is, WHO Mortality Data focusing on the Kenyan insurance industry. <br> The study enhanced the ability of insurance companies to predict and mitigate longevity risk by incorporating both demographic and economic factors into the modeling process. <br> The research analyzed existing mortality models, identified their limitations, and proposed enhancements to improve their predictive accuracy. <br> By doing so, the study bridged the gap between theoretical models and real-world applications, providing insurers with more reliable tools to manage financial risks associated with increasing life expectancies.
